## Feature Descriptions

**YAML Frontmatter / Properties Editor** - Render YAML as a structured property editor when unfocused, raw YAML when the block is focused. Most architecturally significant addition.

**Word/Character/Reading Time Counter** - Status bar with live writing stats.

**Inline Image Preview** - Render `![alt](url)` as actual images with size constraints when unfocused.

**Tag System with Autocomplete** - Support `#tag` and `#tag/subtag`, render as styled pills, autocomplete from user-supplied list.

**Smooth Preview Transitions** - Animate the switch between raw markdown and rendered preview with CSS transitions.

**Link Autocomplete Enhancement** - Promote wiki-link autocomplete from demo-only to a first-class configurable feature.

**Backlinks / Linked Mentions API** - API for incoming links via `onBacklinksRequested(docTitle)`.

**Colored Heading Indicators** - Small colored dots next to headings for visual hierarchy.

**Inline Hashtag Rendering** - Render `#tags` as colored, clickable pills inline.

**Sentence-Level Syntax Awareness** - Highlight parts of speech, flag long sentences, show sentence boundaries.
